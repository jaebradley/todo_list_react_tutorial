# Todo List React Teaching Project
* Another step in learning React!  This time, I tried to develop something with no pre-existing source code to look at (just pure, 100% unadulterated scrap heap code from yours truly).
* Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/react-js-flux-architecture-tutorial), though I think our code is quite different. Here's the [aforementioned tutorial in action](http://chrisharrington.github.io/demos/react-todo/).
* The requirements were
  1. Two tasks lists ("Incomplete" and "Complete")
  2. Be able to move a task from "Incomplete" to "Complete" (or vice versa) by clicking on the task
  3. Be able to create a task
* Here's what it looks like: ![alt-text](http://imgur.com/o9zmopd.png)

* Start the server: `node server.js` (make sure to `npm install` all the packages)
